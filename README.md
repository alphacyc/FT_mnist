# FT_mnist
CNN classifier on the Fourier Transform of MNIST data with >96% accuracy

Also has a traditional CNN classifier with ~99.4% accuracy in mnist_baseline

Diffraction imaging techniques (optical or X-ray) in the far-field measure the fourier transform of the real-space object. Recovering  the real-space image from this diffraction data is computationally challenging. Consequently, the ability to extract any information from the FT image is extremely valuable.
